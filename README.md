# Siddhant's Portfolio

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio hosted on GitHub Pages. The site is a single static HTML page styled with TailwindCSS and served directly from the `main` branch.

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview the site.

## Assets

All images used on the site live in the [`images`](images) directory. If an image is not displaying correctly, confirm the file name matches the reference in `index.html`.

The current page uses the following files:

* `hero-banner.png` – illustration shown in the hero section
* `profile.png` – headshot in the About section
* `fakenewsbanner.png` – preview for the Fake News Analysis project
* `spotify-data-banner.png` – preview for the Spotify Data Insights project

Any missing or renamed file will result in a broken image link.
